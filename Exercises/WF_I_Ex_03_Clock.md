### Ex_03: Clock

#### Given

- A CRA

#### Assignment

Build a clock like this one:

![Clock only updates span](Media/Ex_03_Clock_Update.png)

- The clock must display the actual time of day
- Make use of a CRA (unlike in the image above)
- Make sure the clock resides in a `Clock` component
- The `Clock` component has a state variable called `Time`
- Try making use of a class component as well as a functional component
- Upon mounting the component, call the JavaScript function `setInterval ( A, B )` where `A` is a method called `Tick` and `B` must equal 1000 milliseconds so that the time is being updated every second
- In the `Tick` method, `Time` is being updated with the actual time

#### Solution

Paste the content of the resulting Clock.js both as functional component and as class component:

```js (Clock.js - functional)
PASTE CONTENT OF Clock.js HERE (functional)
```

```js (Clock.js - class)
PASTE CONTENT OF Clock.js HERE (class)
```
